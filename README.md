# Plant-disease-Detection


## Objective: 
To find out leaf diseases in plants in real-time so that farmers can take necessary actions as soon as possible.

## Features:
* Android application made with CNN as a deep learning model that is well-suited for image classification. 
* Detects leaf diseases in plants in real-time by taking pictures of their leaves. 
* Performed 10 epochs for better training. 
* Used TFLite to convert the model to tflite file, for loading into mobile devices.

### Some pictures while using the android application:

### Note:
We have not completed this project yet only we can detect tomato leaf disease with this app. We will add more plant diseases and solutions later on. Thanks for Visiting!!
